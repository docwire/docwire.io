# About Us

**Our history of working with industry leaders in every field, combined with 10+ years of development, has made Docwire the longest standing, most dynamic text extraction SDK on the market.**

# Who Are We

**What began as your run of the mill garage band of Commodore 64 tinkerers, has now expanded to a rag-tag team of developers and marketers with a bleeding passion for cutting edge tech. We feel immense pride in every step we take, which is something we believe shows in the quality of what we produce.**

**Our ear-to-the-ground approach not only ensures that we supply a product that is sought after on the market, but is one of, if not the most influential motivator for our actions. Solving self-identified issues is one thing, but helping a client solve their own puzzle is what ultimately scratches that problem-solving itch. We very much operate on a "problem first" basis, prioritizing utility and faster sprints through the disposal of myopic features.**

**As we've continued to tinker with the SDK (as well as various consoles) we've set our eyes on a new goal - Becoming the time saving backbone of digital document processing.**

**This vision has been the guiding hand for all of our actions, leading Docwire to secure industry-leading clients such as PwC Singapore and Tausight, which both dominate the finance and healthcare cyber security sectors respectively.**

**We are now eagerly preparing for the next step in our journey. Might it be a partnership with you?**
